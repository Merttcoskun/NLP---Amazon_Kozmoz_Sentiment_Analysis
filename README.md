<h3> Business Problems <h3>

Kozmos, which produces products focused on home textiles and daily wear and sells through Amazon, aims to increase its sales by analyzing the comments on its products and improving its features according to the complaints it receives. In line with this goal, the comments will be labeled by sentiment analysis and a classification model will be created with the labeled data.

<h3> Dataset Story <h3>

The data set consists of variables indicating the comments made on a particular product group, the comment title, the number of stars, and how many people found the comment useful.

--Star: The number of stars given to the product.
--Helpful: The count of individuals who found the review helpful.
--Title: The title given to the review, a brief summary.
--Review: The actual content of the review given for the product.
